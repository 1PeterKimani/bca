                        <p>ome of us pace around whenever we are tense. Some crack their knuckles, breathe in-out, fidget their legs, listen to music, pretend to gaze in the air or eat junkies. 

My Monday started out in an ordinary fashion but the butterflies kicked in after it was announced that the revered Education CS George Magoha was planning to release KCPE results.

As usual, I had woken up at 6:00 a.m. to attend to the house chores before heading to our family car wash centre to help my uncle in his business. 

When I sat my last KCPE paper, I entered into an agreement with my uncle to help him in running the business at a small fee, thanks to my prowess in maths.

On Monday, I arrived earlier than usual and I was pumped to start working immediately due to the high traffic the business enjoyed during the school holidays. As a bonus, I got to hang out with my friends that accompanied their parents to the car wash centre.

“Goodmorning Dennis. Have you watched the TV today? Magoha says that he is going to release the KCPE results right now. I am sure you performed well,” My uncle, John Kyalo, told me when he arrived at the workshop at around 9:30 a.m. He had always teased me about the results but today, he seemed serious.
I nonchalantly responded that I knew I would pass and pretended to carry on with my work but as the day progressed, the anxiety took over me. 
I dashed home an hour later and promised my uncle that I would return later after I receive my results. Basically, the eagerness was killing me.
It took another three hours before the most dreaded man in education, CS Magoha, took over the screens and read the names of top performers.
I did not hear my name in all the categories he read out loud but I was confident that, owing to the hard work I had put in my work, I did not score anything less than 400 marks. My dream of being a doctor was still very much alive.
“For those candidates and parents at home, you can check your results now by sending an SMS to this number,” directed Magoha at the end of the press briefing.
I sent my Index Number to the code and the 5 minutes of wait that followed are the longest five minutes I experienced in my life.
When the results finally came, not only had I topped the class of 2021, passed with 407 marks. At that point, everything was surreal. I was so happy I ran around our compound shouting at the top of my voice. ‘I made it! I made it!”
Soon after, my friends and neighbours were all around our compound lifting me up. They carried me all the way to my school while singing celebratory songs. 
When I returned home later, I found my father who had gone to work. He congratulated me and asked what I wanted as a present for posting such a stellar performance. 
I was so grateful to Mr Lutta, my class teacher who held my hand and guided me throughout the year. 
He was the one to be appreciated. I believe we have to give credit where it was due and appreciating him would mean more than receiving a gift. 
I had seen an advert for the Redmi Note 11 Pro+ 5G and I asked my dad to purchase it for him. I added my saving on top.  
At the dealer, I was even more astounded to realise what a great gift this would mean to my teacher. 
“Xiaomi, the manufacturers, have boosted the mobile phone market by providing 5G enabled devices including Redmi Note 11 Pro+ 5G and Redmi 10 5G to complement the popular Redmi Note 11 Series,” the seller detailed. 
“The Redmi Note 11 Pro+ 5G is the first-ever Redmi smartphone equipped with 120W wired charging and has a 4,500mAh battery. Charging to 100 per cent takes merely 15 mins.
